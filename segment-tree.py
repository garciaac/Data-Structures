    this class, the addition operator is used to represent a merge of two SegmentNode objects,

        NOTE: 'start' and 'end' refer to the interval of the input data from which to construct a node.
        For example, the root node contains a merge of the entire input data set, so 'start' is zero,
        and 'end' is the length of the data set minus one (since it represents an index). The root node's
        left child is a merge on the first half of the input data, so 'start' is zero, and 'end' is the
        middle index of the data ((start + end) / 2).
        
        If the interval associated with the node only contains one data element (start == end), then
        the node is a leaf of the tree, so a new SegmentNode object should be created with that
        data value. 
        
        Otherwise, the data set needs to be split into two in order to recurse. The midpoint is
        calculated by taking the average of 'start' and 'end' to determine the index of the 
        input data that lies in the middle of 'start' and 'end'. Then, the current node is built
        by merging its left and right children, which are created via recursive build() calls. The
        left child is built using the interval from 'start' to 'midpoint', and the right child is
        built using the interval from 'midpoint+1' to 'end'.
        
        When segment trees are implemented using array (as is the case here), the left child
        of a node is located at index 2i+1, and the right child is located at index 2i+2 where
        i is the index of the node itself. This is identical behavior to standard binary trees.

        This recursive function executes a query on the original data set. The purpose of a 
        segment tree is to improve performance of queries over aribtrary sub-intervals of the
        original data set. For example, in this implementation, a query over a sub-interval 
        returns the sum of all values over that sub-interval. Another example is finiding the
        minimum value over an arbitrary sub-interval. 
        
        With a segment tree, queries are executed in O(log(n)) time since the nodes of a segment
        tree contain the answer to a query over its associated interval. The root node contains 
        the answer to a query over the entire data set. The root's left child contains the answer
        to a query over the first half of the data set. The root's right child contains the answer
        to a query over the second half of the data set. Etc. 
        
        The merge() function is what dictates the answer to a query. In this implementation, a query
        is the sum of a sub-interval, so the merge function adds two nodes' values together. If the
        query were to determine the minimum value of a sub-interval, the merge function would take
        the lesser of the two node values. For different types of queries, different types of SegmentNode
        objects should be used to build the tree. If two types of queries need to be answered, two instances
        of SegmentTree should be created. One should contain a SegmentNode type that represents a merge to
        answer query type A, and the other should contain a different SegmentNode type that represents a merge
        to answer query type B.
        
        Queries are answered in the following manner:
        
        NOTE: 'start' and 'end' are the beginning and ending indices of the sub-interval of the data set.
        
        If the indices of the sub-interval completely overlap the interval of the current node, then
        that node's value should be returned since it contains the answer for at least part of 
        the sub-interval (the other parts would be added as the values propogate up the recursive call
        stack). 
        
        Otherwise, if the sub-interval lies completely outside the node's interval, then the node's
        value should not be included in the query, and the node's null value is returned.
        
        Otherwise, the current node's interval has a partial overlap with the sub-interval, so 
        the function will recurse on the left and right children until complete overlap of 
        intervals is reached.
